<p1>The rules of etiquette for gratuity in India are a little muddled as a colonial past, tourism, and cultural influences clash. In India, tips, typically referred to as baksheesh, are mostly optional. Tipping in India is more about your gut feeling and doesn't follow rigid guidelines; you'll catch on quickly enough as you travel through the country.<br><br>

Generally speaking, the average tip in India is about 10 percent. As always, exact numbers are debatable and depend on the quality of service.

<p2>Uber added tipping to its app just over a year ago, and other rideshare services have allowed riders to tip their drivers for longer than that. But do drivers expect you to tip? Do they rely on them?<br><br>Brett Helling is a former Uber driver who now owns and runs Ridester.com, a resource for drivers. Mr. Helling said he tips drivers between 10 and 20 percent the cost of the trip, based on the level of service. Julia Boyd, an international etiquette consultant, agreed. For U.S. rides, she recommends tipping between 15 and 20 percent for exceptional service, 10 to 15 for good service, and 10 percent for average service</p2>

<p3>Tip big on the first round. In some circles it's common practice to leave a large tip on the first round. Depending on the bar, leave between 50-100% to make a good first impression.<br><br>Tip according to the drink.<br><br>Don't bargain with your bartender. Don't try to convince your bartender to give you a free drink in exchange for a tip. You're asking the bartender to steal, which could get her fired.<br><br>
Tip extra for exceptional service. If your bartender was particularly quick to serve you, or made each drink perfectly, reward his good service. It's the bartender's job to make sure you have a good time.</p>

<p4>Tipping is something most people in the U.S. do to show appreciation for a service rendered. However, there are times when it's appropriate and times when it's not.<br><br>

Do you ever wonder if you're expected to leave a tip, and if so, how much? Don't feel bad as this is a common question.<br><br>Car wash services vary. For a standard, assembly-line car wash, tip $2 to $5 to the person in charge. If you have your car detailed, tip 10 to 20 percent of the total price</p4>

<h1>Room Service</h1>
<img src="r1.jpg"  style="width:38%;" width="500px" height="400px">
<p5>At hotels and resorts in the United States, tipping is very much expected from just about everyone who provides you a service. Although it is not required, you should always tip at hotels and resorts, unless the service was severely lacking in some way.<br><br>

During your stay, make sure to keep several one dollar bills handy in an accessible pocket. If you don't have your tip ready, it's in very poor taste to ask for change. In this situation, it's better to skip the tip in the moment and return with your tip in exact change at some point in the future.<br><br>

If you would like to ensure special service throughout your stay, a larger tip up front is a good idea. However, higher-end hotels are increasingly instituting "no tipping</p5>
